Open Software License ("OSL") 3.0

This Open Software License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work: "Licensed under the Open Software License 3.0."

1. Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following:

   a. To reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;
   b. To translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works");
   c. To distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your choice that does not contradict the terms and conditions, including Licensor’s reserved rights and remedies under this License; and
   d. To perform the Original Work publicly.

2. Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3. Redistribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works. You may distribute copies of the Original Work or Derivative Works under a license of your choice that conforms to the requirements of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Original Work or Derivative Work you distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Original Work or Derivative Works that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Original Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute the Original Work or Derivative Works with any technological measures that control access or use of the Original Work or Derivative Works in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.

4. Representation of Authority to Grant License. If you are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation, company, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to the terms and conditions of this License.

THE ORIGINAL WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE GRANTED HEREUNDER SHALL BE INTERPRETED AS A WARRANTY.

6. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES.

8. Miscellaneous. This License is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Original Work was created. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
